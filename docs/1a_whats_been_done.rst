Summary of past activities
==========================

In developing the first version of the NHRP Open Data portal, the following activities were undertaken:

1. Data sensemaking - understanding the meaning of survey data elements, looking for inconsistencies (such as missing entries, outliers, unexpected values), identifying standard naming conventions for all variables, and identifying new variables required for the analytical dataset.
2. Data restructuring - variable renaming and reformatting, generating thematics subsets of the data.
3. Documenting - creating a detailed step-by-step documentation of all activities carreid out during data sensemaking and restructuring, which is available here: http://open-hrrp.readthedocs.io
4. Designing, developing and deploying Nepal Earthquake 2015: Open Data Portal which is now available through the National Planning Commission website (http://npc.gov.np/en#Home).
5. Showcasing the data portal and collecting feedback - demonstrating the portal to various stakeholders and collecting their suggestions and feedback.

In showcasing the portal to various stakeholders (municipalities, planners, development agencies, etc.), additional features were suggested and identified, which if incorporated would enhance the usefulness of this portal. For example, the existing portal contains data based on older administrative boundaries. Since Nepal has moved to the new federal system, the portal data would be more relevant if they were transformed into the new administrative boundaries. In order to address these and other relevant feature addition requests, Phase II of Open Data Portal is underway, starting in April 2018. This inception report provides a status update from Apr to May 4.
