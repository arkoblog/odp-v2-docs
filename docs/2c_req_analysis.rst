Requirements gathering
======================

Requirements gathering (or need-finding) involves a systematic, user-centered review of the applicationâ€™s usability (how well users can navigate the existing system) as well as its functionality (what users expect the system to help them with). This exercise will help us gain a deeper understanding of the potential users of our tools, understanding their information needs, and identifying gaps and possible enhancements thereby enabling us to tailor the portal to meet identified needs.
