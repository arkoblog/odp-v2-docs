Requirements gathering
======================

Requirements gathering (or need-finding) involves a systematic, user-centered review of the application’s usability (how well users can navigate the existing system) as well as its functionality (what users expect the system help them with). This exercise will help us gain a deeper understanding of the potential users of our tools, understanding their information needs, and identifying gaps and possible enhancements thereby enabling us to tailor the portal to meet identified needs.


Why is it needed?
#################

User interface design is a costly activity, and UI failures identified at the final stages of development are hard to fix, often requiring developers to do away with previous work and re-work from scratch.

Since the portal's initial release in December 2017, KLL has had the chance to showcase the tool to multiple stakeholders from diverse backgrounds (central and local government bodies, civil-society and development organizations, researchers and students etc.). This has allowed us to get a sneak peek on potential end users, their data needs, as well as their technical capacity in consume this data.

Furthermore, the recent exercise of remapping data into Nepal’s newer administrative boundaries has unarguably made this portal all the more relevant in the eyes of both government as well as non-governmental actors.

Given our improved understanding of the portal’s potential end-users over the last few months, the increased relevance of the information made available through the portal (specially after the administrative remapping exercise), and the fact that a functional system is already in place, KLL feels that spending time on requirements gathering and soliciting feedback at this stage would be highly beneficial in designing a system that is usable and maintainable in the long run.

Objectives
==========

During the requirements KLL will be focusing on

**1. Testing and validating our assumptions about the end users of our tool, and their data needs**

  - Who are these users and where do they work (CSOs, INGOs, local and central governments),
  - How similar/different are their data needs (using/analysing data for planning vs. facilitating data collection)?
  - Where did they look for data in the past? Is it really mayors and elected representatives that will be the 'primary' end users of the system? Or do they assign someone else to carry out data related tasks for them?
  - Why are they looking for data in the first place? Where does the demand for this data originate?

    - regional projects such as WASH planning, literacy programs.
    - internal local governance needs, eg. social security disbursal, identification of earthquake victims that the survey left out?,

  - What is the nature of the data that they're looking for? What are some commonly pursued themes (socio economic data, sanitation data, etc)?


**2. Test and validating our assumptions about the end users' capacity building and training needs**

  - Are end users actually capable of looking for, and arriving at the data they need?
  - Are end-users capable of correctly interpreting and/or consuming the data they arrive at?
  - Do they trust the information? If not why?
