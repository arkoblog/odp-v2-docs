Following the 2015 Nepal earthquake, the Housing Registration for Housing Reconstruction Programme survey was conducted. The digital survey was funded by ‘The Nepal Earthquake Housing Reconstruction Multi-Donor Trust Fund’ of the World Bank and was overseen by the National Planning Commission (NPC) together with the then Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MoFALD) and the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD). The survey was managed by Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Kathmandu Living Labs (KLL) provided all technology-related support (app development, MIS system design, server system deployment, training surveyors etc.).

The digital dataset thus produced by this survey is one of the largest datasets ever collected, containing valuable information on earthquake impact, household conditions, and socio-economic demographics of the affected regions. Understanding that the information on this survey has a wide variety of potential applications beyond just household reconstruction, the Department for International Development (DFID) via The Asia Foundation (TAF) funded the development of Open Data Portal (ODP). Phase I of this portal is available through the National Planning Commission’s website (https://opendata.klldev.org/#/).
