**Feedback and suggestions**:

1. IT officers also often have to act as Information officers. People or organizations seeking information on municipalities are generally sent to them by their superiors and peers.
2. The most common kind of data that is sought of them are socio-economic data. This is true for both individuals and organizations who come to municipalities.
3. The go-to data source for IT officers currently is the CBS census data of 2011. CBS has restructured its 2011 census data according to the new gaunpalika/nagarpalika structure.
4. “I am thinking why I did not know of this portal before. This is newer than CBS census data and also easily shareable. I can direct data-seekers to the site easily now.” - IT Officer, Molung Gaunpalika.
5. “Data-based planning is not practiced very often by elected officials and municipal officers. For the former, the priority is physical infrastructures like roads, etc.” - ITOs
6. “People still prefer to get hardcopy of data.” - ITOs
7. “Internet connectivity is an issue (internet through dedicated ISPs, i.e.) Internet connections through NTC/Ncell are better.” - ITOs. This is even true for some areas of Nagarjun nagarpalika which is in Kathmandu.
8. “FB is common in villages as well. Reach of the same post on Facebook vs palika website is higher for Facebook post.” - ITOs (Nagarjun, Nilkantha, Molung, Tripursundari)
9. Most of the palikas are now involved in municipal profile works. Some are getting it done through third-party agencies. Others are thinking of starting it. Irrespective of the status, all palikas agreed that digital survey is the way to go. However, they do not have plans on how to use the collected data other than creating the profiles. They also do not have enough manpower like trained statistician to work with the collected data. For those palikas which have finished collecting data, the third-party typically provides them with the hard-copy of the processed data (printed reports) only.
10. List of entities who seek ODP-like data (mostly socio-economic):

 - Individuals
 - Organizations (Gramin Mahila Jagaran in <> district, Banks)
 - They seek data within new municipal boundaries.

11. Observations on ODP usage by the participants:

 - They noticed the data is reconfigured for new admin boundaries and they found it be immensely useful.
 - Most of them did not notice they could download charts or data on the GENERATE page.
 - Most of them did not notice COMPARE DISTRICTS/MUNICIPALITIES feature on the EXPLORE page.
