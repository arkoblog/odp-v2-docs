**Meeting Notes**:

- **End User Data Needs and Information Flow**

    *What are their typical information needs?*

      A myriad of data needs on population, households, migration, social security benefits, drinking water, etc.

      Accurate identification of earthquake-affected beneficiary households  is still difficult. Panchkhal wants to do something to redress the grievances of those who were left out from the beneficiary lists.

      Each local government unit including Panchkhal Nagarpalika is constitutionally required to prepare a Nagarpalika/Gaunpalika profile. Panchkhal Nagarpalika has already started collecting such data. The work is scheduled to be completed by the end of September 2018.

      They have multiple data sources for some sectors but the numbers vary quite drastically across data sets. Currently, they do not have proper plans or resources to solve it.

    *Who within the organization seek the kind of information provided by ODP?*

      Mostly decision makers such as the Mayor, the Deputy Mayor and the Chief Executive Officer of Panchkhal. But they usually delegate such data-related tasks (solicitation, searching) to their subordinates.


    *How do they solicit, collect such information?*

      Until now, the Nagarpalika is using the 2011 census profile for most of its purposes. But this is problematic because this dataset is outdated and is not reconfigured for the new admin boundaries. Currently, in a bid to create their Nagarpalika profile, they are collecting basic data from households using traditional pen and paper survey (the questionnaire is reportedly 4 pages).

      Panchkhal Nagarpalika is currently receiving help from INGOs to collect specific data such as WASH-related data.

    *What does it plan to do with the collected data?*

      The Nagarpalika does not have trained statisticians. Currently, it plans to pass the collected data to its IT officer for possible data processing. According to the Deputy Mayor, the collected data will most probably culminate in a typical report which will then be made available as a PDF document on their existing website.

    *Where do these demands come from?*

      - From within the Nagarpalika, e.g. for Nagarpalika profile
      - From general citizens who ask for socio-economic data.
      - From NGOs and INGOs who are working in Panchkhal. Some of these projects also collect and produce data, however, it is not sure if the Nagarpalika is entitled to have access to such data.

- **Training**

      Training on data literacy and data tools would be useful.

      Who would be the right people to train?
        - Both elected representatives and IT officers. However, their training needs are different.
        - In addition, putting elected representatives and IT officers in the same training would not be beneficial because they have different level of understanding when it comes to computers. So stratified training where audience are homogeneous is recommended.




- **ODP Feedback (As told by the participants)**

   - “One idea could be that new (latest) data can be added to ODP.”
   - “Seeing huge datasets in maps is helpful. This will help us understand data and make more informed decisions.”
   - “A formal presentation to the Mayor, the Chief Executive Officer and other officials would be fruitful.”
