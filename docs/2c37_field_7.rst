**Feedback and suggestions**:

 - On slower networks, load time is an issue. Is there something that can be done to decrease load time?
 - "I like the black toast message on top of the map. It is always there and yet does not obscure anything." - Craig.
 - Participants did not hover on top of charts in the GENERATE section. So all information which is visible on 'hover' are not apparent to the users.
 - Neil did not see the DOWNLOAD button at the bottom after selecting datasets to download (DOWNLOAD section).
 - COMPARE (district/palika) feature is not visible. Only Neil found out it existed. After seeing the comparison chart, he said, "I could not find much use of it thereafter."
 - Neil suggested adding cross-tabulation feature. He also suggested showing 'preset' cross-tabs right in the front so that people know that bi/multi-variate analyses are possible. This would also give the visitors a 'springboard' to start from there.
 - Tirza emphasized on using google analytics to understand the actual use case, for example, who is using the portal (government, palikas, individuals, students, researchers?) and for what (profile, research, projects?)
 - Tirza suggested adding a survey form on the current ODP site to capture these information.
 - “The users of the portal can also be determined by the way the portal is designed.” - Neil.
 - It was suggested that we look at other datasets that could be added to the portal, e.g. subsequent data collected by NRA; datasets pertaining to the distribution of grants to earthquake victims, etc.
