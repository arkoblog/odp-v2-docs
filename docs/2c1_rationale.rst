Rationale for assessment

User interface design is a costly activity, and UI failures identified at the final stages of development are hard to fix, often requiring developers to do away with previous work and re-work from scratch.

Since the portal's initial release in December 2017, KLL has had the chance to showcase the tool to multiple stakeholders from diverse backgrounds (central and local government bodies, civil-society and development organizations, researchers and students etc.). This has allowed us to get a sneak peek on potential end users, their data needs, as well as their technical capacity in consuming this data.

Furthermore, the recent exercise of remapping data into Nepal’s newer administrative boundaries has unarguably made this portal all the more relevant in the eyes of both government as well as non-governmental actors.

Given our improved understanding of the portal’s potential end-users over the last few months, the increased relevance of the information made available through the portal (specially after the administrative remapping exercise), and the fact that a functional system is already in place, KLL feels that spending time on requirements gathering and soliciting feedback at this stage would be highly beneficial in designing a system that is usable and maintainable in the long run.
