**Meeting Notes**:

- **End User Data Needs and Information Flow**

    *What is the nature of their relationship with data?*

      The LGCDP primarily is interested in collecting data across various themes (socio-economic, agriculture data, etc.) based on ministry requirements. For doing so they centrally coordinate and facilitate data collection activities with different local government units. Currently they manage this process using simple tools like google sheets where they share required data formats with local units. The data collection activity is then carried out independently by the local units and sent back to the LGCDP.

    *LGCDP’s experiences on data needs, information flow and use*

      The majority of their data related activities comprise of collecting data in socio-economic themes (education, migration, etc.), which can then be used in activities such as yearly budget planning, identification of focus areas, etc.

      It is difficult to collect data as per the specified requirements. In some cases, local governments simply search for the data online and send it back.

      Updating collected information is difficult owing to several factors like funding, local level politics, and the interests of these local bodies.

      Effort needs to be put in “awareness” activities that explain the role and importance of data to local units. The team repeatedly stressed how simple products such as pamphlets and brochures can go a long way in trying to achieve this.

      Furthermore, it would be beneficial if there is a way to “demonstrate” how data can help in their decision making. Maybe help these units compile and visualize data that they help collect.


- **ODP Feedback (As told by the participants)**

   - “The data made available is very helpful, but it isn’t comprehensive as per GoN’s new directive. The current guidelines are available `here <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6RiLsl1G-KVQ2kzMDk0WVNYczZsNmxCZW1iN3ZYMjlzckcw/view>`_.” - Nagesh Badu, e-Governance expert.

   - It would be helpful if we use a sidebar layout in the generate section for different themes.

   - “Since we’re building it for Nepal, the information present should be made available in Nepali”.

- **ODP Feedback (As observed by KLL)**

   - Participants didn’t realize that the map based explore section contained information at the gaupalika level.
   - Participants weren’t very keen on visiting the download section.
