**Notes**:

  - Participants wanted to know if there was any steps taken to validate the data collection process. In other words, was ther a mechanism to verify the fact that the data collected is accurate. Sazal mentioned that no such process was employed by CBS.
  - Participants were quick to grasp the importance of this data, However, they were concerned about the fact that there is no routine information available. The fact that this data-set is a snapshot means its usability will decline over time.
  - Interested to understand if there is more data that can be integrated into the system.
  - Prefer playing with the data in their own environments, and are more inclined to download raw data. Less interested in the visualizations.
  - GIZ has direct access to specific ministries to help fulfill their data needs. In addition, they are equally capable of conducting surveys to gather required data.
  - GIZ usually collects data using their own means partly due to unreliability in the methodology employed by external actors in collecting  this informantion. They are also skeptical of the data collected by external local actors.
  - Participants were able to point out several use cases of the data, ranging from estimating timber production, to understanding variation in earthquake damage across male and female headed households.
  - They also asked about any future plans to design APIs around this data.
