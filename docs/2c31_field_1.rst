**Meeting Notes**:

- **End User Data Needs and Information Flow**

    *What are their typical information needs?*

      As CSOs working in districts, they are often looking for the latest socio-economic data in their implementation areas. Generally, information related to education, health, irrigation and drinking water are important to them.


    *Who within the organization seek the kind of information provided by ODP?*

      Mostly program heads need this kind of information to identify size and location of target beneficiaries. Recently, one of the program heads was required by a donor to collect similar data on education. Since he was unaware about the existence of such data, he spent time and personnel to collect those data.


    *How do they solicit, collect such information?*

      Typically, their first choice is the census data collected by CBS in 2011. Few other updated datasets exist for niche areas in health and education. They do tend to search for available data on the internet but they reported that they do not find much useful data online. Occasionally, they also send their own personnel on field to collect data. In the case of this CSO, the information seekers (mostly program heads) were also the ultimate users of such data. They might assign data collection tasks as such to their subordinates (in case of fresh data collection). Otherwise, they are the ones who feel the need of data, search them online and ultimately use them for various project purposes.


    *Where do these demands come from?*

      For this particular CSO, the demand for such data were mostly project-driven.

- **ODP Feedback (As told by the participants)**

   - “This contains a lot of useful data. It contains a lot of data that we spent a lot of time looking for.” - Suzan Nepali, Program Assistant.

   - “They made us collect a lot of similar data recently. If we knew this existed, then it would have saved time.” - Nabaraj Pathik, District Coordinator for Ramechhap.

   - “Our donors should also be informed about this. I will also share this website in the upcoming DRR (Disaster Risk Reduction) meetings and PPWG (Public Private Working Group) meetings. Also, will solicit their feedback.” - Sher Bahadur Bhujel, Program Officer.
